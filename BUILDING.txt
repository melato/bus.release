The code for Athens Next Bus is divided in 9 submodules, each of which has its oown git repository.  This project is used to build everything.
There are two Android projects:

melato.android.lib
	Contains common code shared by an other application.
	Uses:
		xml
		gps
		progress
		util

bus.android
	The final Athens Next Bus app.
	Uses:
		melato.android.lib
		geometry
		bus

To build in Eclipse:
	Open each of the two android projects.  
	If necessary, link the source folders for the dependent projects.

To build from the command line (on linux), execute:
build-lib.sh
build.sh

These are the build scripts that I use to make the production apk.
They are not meant to be fool-proof and they may need to be tweaked for your installation

Icons:
The app source code contains only the mdpi icons.
I generate all the icons in various densities from .svg files and add them
to ./external/res/drawable-* folders in this directory, before running build.sh.

I have not published the .svg icon files yet.
They are taken or adapted from open source icons, or created by me.
